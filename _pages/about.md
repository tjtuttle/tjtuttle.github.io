I am a second year graduate student at University of California, San Diego (UCSD). I am fortunate to be advised by [Hao Zhang](https://cseweb.ucsd.edu/~haozhang/). My research interests lie in the intersection between machine learning, distributed systems, and high performance computing. 
In my first year of graduate school I was a teaching assistant for DSC 102 for Fall, Winter, and Spring quarters. This year I am a teaching assistant for the [capstone] (https://dsc-capstone.org/).
