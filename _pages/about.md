I am currently the Chief Technology Officer (CTO) at [CTGT](https://ctgt.ai).

I was a graduate student at the University of California, San Diego (UCSD). I was fortunate to have been advised by [Hao Zhang](https://cseweb.ucsd.edu/~haozhang/). My research interests lied in the intersection between machine learning, distributed systems, and high performance computing. 
In my first year I was a teaching assistant for DSC 102 during the Fall, Winter, and Spring quarters. My second year I was a teaching assistant for the [capstone](https://dsc-capstone.org/). 

You can find a my thoughts on various topics, academic or otherwise, at the blog. In my free time, I enjoy reading, exploring languages, and indulging in diverse culinary experiences.
