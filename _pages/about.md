I am a second year graduate student at University of California, San Diego (UCSD). I am fortunate to be advised by [Hao Zhang](https://cseweb.ucsd.edu/~haozhang/). My research interests lie in the intersection between machine learning, distributed systems, and high performance computing. 
In my first year I was a teaching assistant for DSC 102 during the Fall, Winter, and Spring quarters. This year I am a teaching assistant for the [capstone](https://dsc-capstone.org/). 

You can find a my thoughts on various topics, academic or otherwise, at the blog. In my free time, I enjoy reading, exploring languages, and indulging in diverse culinary experiences. If you share any of these interests, feel free to reach out via email—I’d love to chat!
