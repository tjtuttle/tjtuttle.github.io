This course covers the principles of computing systems and tools for scaling data analytics to large datasets. Scalable analytics systems are a central part of modern data science in numerous application domains spanning enterprise business intelligence, Web search, e-commerce, social media, natural and social sciences, healthcare, digital humanities, e-governance, Internet of Things, and more.

Topics include basics of computer organization, memory hierarchy, operating systems, and cloud computing; principles of scalable and parallel data-intensive computing; design and use of parallel dataflow systems (MapReduce/Hadoop and Spark); and scaling of end-to-end machine learning (ML) workloads. It will cover how relational algebra, SQL, linear algebra, and more general dataflow operations in such systems can be used to perform data preparation and feature engineering for ML at scale, how to scale ML model building, and how to handle data heterogeneity.

A major component of this course is hands-on Python programming to implement data exploration, data preparation, and model selection pipelines on large real-world data using scalable analytics tools and cloud resources, both Amazon Web Services (AWS) public cloud and SDSCâ€™s private cloud.
